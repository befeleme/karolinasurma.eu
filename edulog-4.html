          <p>That's been a ride. A bit of cold in the middle of March and diving deep in RPM ecosystem.
I tried to sink into <a href="https://www.factorio.com/">Factorio</a> to relax, but it keeps feeling as if I just went from one job to another. It has some real charm though, so I hope I'll find my way around it.</p>
<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
<p>In the middle of March I joined the big Python team course as a home assignments couch.
Maybe I should focus rather on good coding practices, but I figured - I miss community courses and still have some time and energy, so I jumped right in the turtle pictures ;).
This one feels completely different though. Without the power from personal encounters (saying me - not really a people's person), the whole process is much more mechanical. 
I start to understand the benefits of <a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC course</a> one community member proposed around a year ago to rather uninterested audience.</p>
<h2>Last few weeks I learned / read / attended</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to add desktop entries to programs in GNOME environment :).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to test RPM packages using containers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to organize changes into readable commits (and that <code>git rebase --interactive</code> is indeed my good friend).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrote the solutions to Lab 1 and Problem Set 1 from <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/1/">CS50 course</a>.
I realized that <strong>C</strong> requires a different approach and understood what some people mean by <em>thinking in a language</em>. 
Being limited by what can be done, made me craft my algorithms in much careful (and, to be honest, mathematical) way I would with Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went on a meetup regarding financial negotiations. 
A bit out-of-time as I am just past this phase. I'm happy to have attended though, I met a long-lost friend there and spent a super interesting evening with CyberMagnolia ladies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to Daria's lecture on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DariaGrudzien/junioring-101-how-not-to-go-bonkers-at-the-start-devconfcz-2021">Junioring 101</a> for <a href="https://junior.guru/">Junior.Guru club</a>. 
  This time with a longer story about what a Site Reliability Engineer is and her own path towards tech - insightful and fun. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to online board game evening with my team. After a year of pandemic it didn't occur to me that there still exist some ways to hang out with people. Weird, I used to play a lot on <a href="https://kurnik.pl">kurnik</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3q5bp1ykttgqutu/prezentace.html?dl=1">Lumir's advice</a> to learn new habits by placing them next to our old ones and having decided I won't continue on running in my (rather broken at the moment) sport's routine, I'm in the middle of creating habit of ~1-hour-long walks with podcasts. Working well so far!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuing on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map">The Culture Map by Erin Meyer</a>. 
I see that my uncertainty regarding how to behave in business situations is justified. 
I identified some situations that made me uncomfortable in the past which were just a neutral part of the <em>source</em> culture. 
Hopefully I'll find time to write down some notes from the book.</p>
