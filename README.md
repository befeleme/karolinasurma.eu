# karolinasurma.eu

My personal blog, running on [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), the static site generator written in Python.

The theme (`theme` directory) is based on [MinimalXY](https://github.com/petrnohejl/MinimalXY) by Petr Nohejl with many edits on the way.

## Deployment

The site is generated and deployed directly from GitHub using GitHub Actions.
