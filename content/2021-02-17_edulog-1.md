## Accomplishments

- [Vege JMK - dynamic map](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/vege-jmk_557579) showing raw data + [GitHub repo with data](https://github.com/befeleme/vegan_JMK)
- [static map](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/veg-jmk-preprocessed_563879) showing preprocessed data (Proof of concept)

I shall continue on the preprocessed one, it reflects the reality better.

## Last week I learned

- how to create maps using uMap, plenty of clicking and some fun included.
- how to use GitHub Actions to deploy static website to a branch that is then served.
- what is quick sort and how to implement it in [Python](https://stackabuse.com/quicksort-in-python/).
- how does the _.spec_ file look like. RPM packages are created from them.
- about the ways some communities work and why do they part their ways when business comes into scene.
Inspired by the story of [HegdeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/history/), once derivate of [HackMD.io](https://hackmd.io/) which I use a lot.
- I can't estimate development time well. It took me around 5x more to create the first map than I expected.
- a lot of various stuff from [junior.guru club](https://junior.guru/club/). I wasn't sure I'll benefit from there, I am. 

I intend to purchase the access once I start getting paid again :)

## Plans and hopes

- listen to the story of ownCloud CTO who [forked his repo and started Nextcloud](https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/nextcloud/)
- check out the [Fall of civilizations](https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/) podcast
