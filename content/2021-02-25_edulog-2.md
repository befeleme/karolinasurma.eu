My "free" month is at its end and I decided to spend most of the time doing whatever I feel like to. 
This includes taking long walks, playing board games and watching Doctor Who's last season.  

I received plenty of information about onboarding at my new employer which is held online.
Even though it was my call to switch jobs in the middle of pandemic, I still feel a bit uneasy when it comes to 100 % remote work for the next months.


## Accomplishments
- changed processing of the underlying data of my map. 
  I added a Python script that sorts restaurants into 4 categories depending on present tags.

## Last week
- Read about [Pattern Matching](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/), the new planned feature in Python 3.10 and tried to wrap my head around the concept.
- Attended a few talks on [DevConf](https://www.devconf.info/cz/).
    - [Junioring 101](https://www.slideshare.net/DariaGrudzien/junioring-101-how-not-to-go-bonkers-at-the-start-devconfcz-2021) by Daria Grudzie≈Ñ - I need to implement all of this :D
    - [Containers are Linux](https://devconfcz2021.sched.com/event/gmSb/containers-are-linux-but-what-does-it-mean) - hands-on workshop with the basics of virtualization. Quite fun and rewarding.
- Listened to a few episodes of [Easy German Podcast](https://www.easygerman.org/podcast) and I still find it the best out there for B2 level.
  My favourite podcast for walking!
- Listened to an episode about women in project management called [_Sassy or assertive_](https://pmhappyhour.com/012-2/) followed by reading the beginning of famous book [_Lean in_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16071764-lean-in) by Sheryl Sandberg. 
  Both very interesting but I find the diversity and discrimination topic increasingly harder to take, knowing I have no tools to change the system. 
  I'd better focus on my job.

## Plans and hopes
- I found out about [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) and decided to take a look at C lectures.
