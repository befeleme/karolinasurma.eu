That's been a ride. A bit of cold in the middle of March and diving deep in RPM ecosystem.
I tried to sink into [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) to relax, but it keeps feeling as if I just went from one job to another. It has some real charm though, so I hope I'll find my way around it.


## Accomplishments

In the middle of March I joined the big Python team course as a home assignments couch.
Maybe I should focus rather on good coding practices, but I figured - I miss community courses and still have some time and energy, so I jumped right in the turtle pictures ;).
This one feels completely different though. Without the power from personal encounters (saying me - not really a people's person), the whole process is much more mechanical. 
I start to understand the benefits of [MOOC course](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) one community member proposed around a year ago to rather uninterested audience.


## Last few weeks I learned / read / attended
- How to add desktop entries to programs in GNOME environment :).

- How to test RPM packages using containers.

- How to organize changes into readable commits (and that `git rebase --interactive` is indeed my good friend).

- I wrote the solutions to Lab 1 and Problem Set 1 from [CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/1/).
I realized that **C** requires a different approach and understood what some people mean by *thinking in a language*. 
Being limited by what can be done, made me craft my algorithms in much careful (and, to be honest, mathematical) way I would with Python.

- I went on a meetup regarding financial negotiations. 
A bit out-of-time as I am just past this phase. I'm happy to have attended though, I met a long-lost friend there and spent a super interesting evening with CyberMagnolia ladies.

- And to Daria's lecture on [Junioring 101](https://www.slideshare.net/DariaGrudzien/junioring-101-how-not-to-go-bonkers-at-the-start-devconfcz-2021) for [Junior.Guru club](https://junior.guru/). 
  This time with a longer story about what a Site Reliability Engineer is and her own path towards tech - insightful and fun. 
  
- And to online board game evening with my team. After a year of pandemic it didn't occur to me that there still exist some ways to hang out with people. Weird, I used to play a lot on [kurnik](https://kurnik.pl). 
  
- Following [Lumir's advice](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3q5bp1ykttgqutu/prezentace.html?dl=1) to learn new habits by placing them next to our old ones and having decided I won't continue on running in my (rather broken at the moment) sport's routine, I'm in the middle of creating habit of ~1-hour-long walks with podcasts. Working well so far!

- Continuing on [The Culture Map by Erin Meyer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map). 
I see that my uncertainty regarding how to behave in business situations is justified. 
I identified some situations that made me uncomfortable in the past which were just a neutral part of the _source_ culture. 
Hopefully I'll find time to write down some notes from the book.
