  I find it the best flash card application, mobile [AnkiDroid can be found on f-droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.ichi2.anki/).
- "es" can be skipped if the whole clause plays the role of subject (2).
If the main clause stays at the beginning, there must be pronoun subject present, and the clause is followed by a comma (1a, 1b).
The only applicable pronoun subject is "es", "das" can't be used instead.

> 1a) **Es** ist notwendig, alle Aufgaben durchzusehen.

> 1b) Notwendig ist **es**, alle Aufgaben durchzusehen.

> 2) Alle Aufgaben durchzusehen ist notwendig.
