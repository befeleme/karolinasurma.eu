As winter came, we decided to keep the good streak of talks given and sent an application to the Czech [DevConf](https://www.devconf.info/cz/).
Again we teamed up with Ane≈æka and delivered a presentation called [PyLadies Community in Brno: Mutual Help to Grow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EuNGz8-Y3M&list=PLU1vS0speL2bf9Zfa0pHQLPBhEKbbbsua&index=85).

This time we focused on what drives the community builders: the people who enable the community's main focus.
There are organizers, coaches, lecturers (also called the *main coaches*) and we realized, in short, two things:

- the motivation to **join** a community often isn't the same one which prompts a person to **stay** in a community
- there are real-life skills and gains to grab other than the *whatever the community is about*

We hoped for a real life talk on a hybrid conference which eventually wasn't possible.
But the conference org team has no power over a global pandemic, so I'll just stop whining here.
Kudos to the organizers who did a great job making it work virtually!

Much satisfaction, would do it again. :)
