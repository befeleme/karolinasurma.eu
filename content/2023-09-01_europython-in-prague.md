It almost feels as if this year was the first real one after Covid! 
When it comes to Python, 2023 has brought two big conferences to Prague: EuroPython and, after a covid break, PyCon CZ.

A short report of PyLadies' activities can be found on the [official blog](https://blog.python.cz/pyladies-byly-jsme-na-europythonu) of the Czech Python community.
